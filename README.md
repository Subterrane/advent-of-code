## Environment

I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). Since I'm currently learning React, I enabled the ES6 module imports in Node with the `--experimental-modules` flag. I left the `.vscode` in the repo instead of hiding it so others can use it to run `index.mjs` in debug mode.

You could also run with `npm start` if you just want to see the output without running the debugger.
